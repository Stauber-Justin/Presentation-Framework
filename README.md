# Presentation Framework

A lightweight modular web presentation system written in vanilla JavaScript. Slides are loaded at runtime from standalone HTML files listed in `config/slides.json`.

## Quick Setup

1. Clone or copy the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in any modern browser â€“ no server required.
3. Use the arrow keys or the on-screen arrows to navigate.

## Extending

* Add new slide HTML files under `pages/`.
* Reference the slide path inside `config/slides.json`.
* Use the hooks in the JS modules to integrate features like touch navigation or speaker notes.
